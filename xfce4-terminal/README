If you use Xfce4 Terminal and want the peaksea dark color in 16-color mode, 

then put the schema in the following path:

~/.config/Terminal/terminalrc


Note: xfce4 does not have a separate color scheme file, so the above will overwrite your own non-color-related settings. You can do a diff/merge if you really want.
